## Project Description

This project automates the task of creating events in Google Calendar as reminders for specific vegan days based on the lunar calendar and Vietnamese lunar calendar holidays. The vegan days are observed on the 14th, 15th, last, and first days of each month in the lunar calendar. These events will be set as reminders in the Gregorian calendar, making it easier to track important dates without manually calculating them.
